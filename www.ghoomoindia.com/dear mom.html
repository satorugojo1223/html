<h3>additional para - 
    My mom is the most precious person in my life, and no words can ever be enough to describe how much she means to me. From the moment I wake up until I go to bed, she is always there making sure I am happy, safe, and cared for. She sacrifices so much for me every single day without ever complaining, and her love is the purest and most unconditional love I have ever known. She teaches me important lessons about kindness, honesty, and hard work, and she inspires me to always do my best in everything. When I feel sad or weak, her gentle words give me courage, and when I achieve something, her proud smile makes me feel like the happiest person in the world. She always puts my needs above her own and makes countless efforts just to see me succeed and live a good life. I love my mom not only because she takes care of me but also because she is my best friend, my guide, and my greatest source of strength. I promise that I will always respect her, listen to her, and try to bring a smile to her face every single day, because she truly deserves all the happiness in the world. No matter how old I get, I will always be her child, and I will always love her more than words can express.
</h3>
  <h1 class="heart">I Love You, Mom! ❤️💖💝</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.5em;">Thank you for always supporting me and cheering me on 🌸</p>\
