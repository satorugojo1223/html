    <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>

    <p>
      I know you always check on how much I study and whether I'm using my time well. So I wanted to make this page for you‚Äîto tell you honestly what I focused on today and how much effort I truly gave.
    </p>

    <h2>üìê What I Did Today</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I gave my complete focus to one subject: <strong>Maths</strong>. I didn‚Äôt let anything distract me. I sat down, opened my books, and worked through every problem carefully.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Completed all the exercises assigned for the day</li>
      <li> Revised earlier chapters to make sure I remembered the concepts</li>
      <li>Also wrote explaination</li>
      <li>Did this html project for u</li>
      <li>Even made maggi and ate </li>
      <li>I even enjoyed a lot by watching TV</li>
      <li>applied perfume to smell good</li>
      <li>i did complete my work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I know I could have done more subjects, but I didn‚Äôt want to rush or do anything halfway. That‚Äôs why I chose to go deep into just one topic today‚Äîbecause I wanted to get it right. I really tried, and I hope that means something.
    </p>

    <h2>üìä Why Maths?</h2>
    <p>
       u said to do maths and so i did it on ur order and now im fully completed with it .Maths is something I sometimes struggle with, and I know you've seen that. That‚Äôs exactly why I gave it all my energy today. I wanted to make you proud by becoming better at it, not just finishing tasks but understanding them.
    </p>

    <h2>üí¨ A Little Message</h2>
    <p>
      I know I may not be perfect, and I may not always do everything expected but please know that I truly care about my studies and your trust in me from today deal i will do this every day im alone. Today may have been just about Maths, but it was still a day of effort, learning, and focus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for always encouraging me, supporting me, and believing in me. Your love makes me want to do better every day.
    </p>
